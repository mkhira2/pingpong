# pingpong

This is an app created by students at The Iron Yard in Houston, TX.

The goal of this app is to create a dynamic webpage that updates a leaderboard automatically after players enter their games in the database.

The back end was created and maintained by Brian Dorton using Ruby on Rails.

The front end is designed by the rest of the world.

Feel free to contribute. Thanks!

We have a live, static, dynamic leaderboard on display in the ping pong room using a raspberry pi and dell monitor. Woo hoo!
