# pingpong
created dynamic leaderboard for tiy in-house ping pong tournaments

This is a PINGPONG app created by students at The Iron Yard in Houston, TX.

The goal of this app is to create a dynamic webpage that updates a leaderboard automatically after players enter their games in the database.

The back end was created and maintained by Brian Dorton using Ruby on Rails.

The front end is designed by the rest of the world.

Feel free to contribute. Thanks!
